My favorite part of any project is figuring out the problem and looking for a solution to the problem. I also have an inherent understanding of what works and what doesn’t. </p>\n  <p>During my schooling at the University of Waterloo School of Interaction Design and Business we had to create many different solutions to many different problems. During each class, we would review the products that people have made and what they do to solve a problem. I would raise my hand after every presentation, usually with a question that would change the group's product and solution. </p>\n  <p>I am great at finding the questions that people haven't asked before analyzing the big picture. </p>\n </b-col>\n <b-col cols=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"6\" lg=\"6\" xl=\"6\">\n  <b-img rounded class=\"image-size\" :src=\"danielImage\" img-alt=\"this is a black and white photo of daniel ruginets, he wears glasses, sometimes has a beard and loves to smile.\"></b-img>\n  </b-col>\n</b-row>\n</b-container>\n<b-container class=\"middle-margin\">\n\n  <h2 class=\"header-padding\"><a class=\"font-deco\">\"In the last 5 years, I have done a lot and learned a lot.\"</a></h2>\n  <h4><span class=\"heading5\">First program at UW</span></h4>\n    <p>I first went to UW for either Theatre or Film (you decide your major after the first year). I wanted to be behind the stage or behind the camera. I learned a lot about acting, about the stage, and about the art of cinema. That summer, I went on a trip to Israel through Birthright. I don’t want to be one of those people that say that this was an “eye-opening” experience, but it was. I wasn’t satisfied with being a theatre major or being a director. I wanted to do something else, something bigger, something that I felt could change the world and make it better. </p>\n    <p>So I switched programs. I have spent the last 4 years learning how to design, how to empathize, how to understand business, and how to see the big picture. </p>\n  <h4><span class=\"heading5\">First year in GBDA</span></h4>\n    <p>In my first year of Global Business and Digital Arts, I started a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9kg3RLnPdV2UBgenstYHDg\">YouTube channel</a> with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danielbrenneman/\">@danielbrenneman</a> who is now one of my best friends. We explored comedy, and filmmaking, in a way I have never done before. We would write a script, take a day to shoot, and 3 days to edit. It was hectic and fun.</p>\n    <p>In the summer of my first year, I was trying to find an internship, I somehow stumbled upon a video making role at SAP in Palo Alto. I’m not sure what I said or did, but they offered me a job and 3 weeks later I flew out to California. To say I learned a lot that summer would be an understatement. It was my first time working at a big corporate company and sitting at a desk. But I did some cool work, in my 3 months there. I had to organize, book, and shoot 19 interviews with students from a class that my co-workers taught at Stanford University. I learned how to write better emails (something I struggled with for a while), I learned how to turn over videos quickly and how to take criticism and feedback.</p>\n    <iframe class=\"image-padding\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kBdk-aKTro\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <p>I also learned how to live in a different city by myself for the first time. I had an almost 2-hour commute while living there, it was a killer. I somehow managed to win a 4K TV from a competition at an Intel conference. And I had a meeting with the CEO of Scoop Technologies. I met people working at Google, Twitter, Facebook. I worked alongside the Chief Design Officer of SAP and many other high-ranking employees. Someone told me a rumor that our building was Apple's first headquarters (not a confirmed rumor). To think I was working where Steve Jobs may have spent hours working - that was awesome. </p>\n    <h4><span class=\"heading5\">Second Year</span></h4>\n    <p>When I returned to Waterloo I had a new found knowledge of Design Thinking (my team taught this at Stanford). And the understanding that I definitely did not want to do film anymore. Most of my second year is a blur for me, I know we learned coding and business. But I don’t know if we made any projects. </p>\n    <p>After my second year, I knew I wanted to be a UX Designer. But with my background, it was hard to get a UX job. So I reached out to my contacts on LinkedIn and SAP and was able to find a position at SAP Waterloo. Throughout my summer there, I learned more and more about UX. We did a couple of projects there, I worked on a video for SAP’s conference that was played by Hasso Plattner (yes that one). It was only 30 seconds long but it was the most stressful week I’ve ever had.</p>\n    <h2 class=\"header-padding\"><a class=\"font-deco\">My most memorable quote from someone was “I’ve worked here for 30 years and I’ve never got that kind of recognition” after my clip played for all SAP to see.</a></h2>\n    <p> For half the summer we worked on two main projects. One was a game to test our predictive analytics system and another was a movie picker for the Toronto International Film Festival. We had a lot of trouble getting both of these done. TIFF was very slow with getting us the information we needed, and the other project was very difficult in scope (we had to do a lot of testing to make it work). My manager had also given me the task of developing the front-end of both of these websites which for me (someone who barely knew how to code) was a difficult task. That summer I learned a couple of things. I learned how to code HTML and CSS, I learned that projects can sometimes be out of your hands and I learned that Waterloo is a little boring in the summer.</p>\n    <h4><span class=\"heading5\">Third Year</span></h4>\n    <p>The third year was a wild ride for me. In our first semester, I worked on a group project to design a product called Mental Health Indigenous. This was a website designed to help Indigenous people who live in northern Ontario with their mental health. We designed a website where people could learn mental health skills, talk to professionals, talk to friends and learn more about their cultures. </p>\n\n</b-container>\n<b-container>\n<b-row class=\"image-padding\">\n  <b-col cols=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"6\" lg=\"6\" xl=\"6\">\n   <b-img rounded class=\"image-size\" :src=\"hk2\" img-alt=\"This is an image someone took of me sitting on top of Lion's Rock Mountain in Hong Kong.

My favorite part of any project is figuring out the problem and looking for a solution to the problem. I also have an inherent understanding of what works and what doesn’t. </p>\n  <p>During my schooling at the University of Waterloo School of Interaction Design and Business we had to create many different solutions to many different problems. During each class, we would review the products that people have made and what they do to solve a problem. I would raise my hand after every presentation, usually with a question that would change the group's product and solution. </p>\n  <p>I am great at finding the questions that people haven't asked before analyzing the big picture. </p>\n </b-col>\n <b-col cols=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"6\" lg=\"6\" xl=\"6\">\n  <b-img rounded class=\"image-size\" :src=\"danielImage\" img-alt=\"this is a black and white photo of daniel ruginets, he wears glasses, sometimes has a beard and loves to smile.\"></b-img>\n  </b-col>\n</b-row>\n</b-container>\n<b-container class=\"middle-margin\">\n\n  <h2 class=\"header-padding\"><a class=\"font-deco\">\"In the last 5 years, I have done a lot and learned a lot.\"</a></h2>\n  <h4><span class=\"heading5\">First program at UW</span></h4>\n    <p>I first went to UW for either Theatre or Film (you decide your major after the first year). I wanted to be behind the stage or behind the camera. I learned a lot about acting, about the stage, and about the art of cinema. That summer, I went on a trip to Israel through Birthright. I don’t want to be one of those people that say that this was an “eye-opening” experience, but it was. I wasn’t satisfied with being a theatre major or being a director. I wanted to do something else, something bigger, something that I felt could change the world and make it better. </p>\n    <p>So I switched programs. I have spent the last 4 years learning how to design, how to empathize, how to understand business, and how to see the big picture. </p>\n  <h4><span class=\"heading5\">First year in GBDA</span></h4>\n    <p>In my first year of Global Business and Digital Arts, I started a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9kg3RLnPdV2UBgenstYHDg\">YouTube channel</a> with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danielbrenneman/\">@danielbrenneman</a> who is now one of my best friends. We explored comedy, and filmmaking, in a way I have never done before. We would write a script, take a day to shoot, and 3 days to edit. It was hectic and fun.</p>\n    <p>In the summer of my first year, I was trying to find an internship, I somehow stumbled upon a video making role at SAP in Palo Alto. I’m not sure what I said or did, but they offered me a job and 3 weeks later I flew out to California. To say I learned a lot that summer would be an understatement. It was my first time working at a big corporate company and sitting at a desk. But I did some cool work, in my 3 months there. I had to organize, book, and shoot 19 interviews with students from a class that my co-workers taught at Stanford University. I learned how to write better emails (something I struggled with for a while), I learned how to turn over videos quickly and how to take criticism and feedback.</p>\n    <iframe class=\"image-padding\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kBdk-aKTro\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <p>I also learned how to live in a different city by myself for the first time. I had an almost 2-hour commute while living there, it was a killer. I somehow managed to win a 4K TV from a competition at an Intel conference. And I had a meeting with the CEO of Scoop Technologies. I met people working at Google, Twitter, Facebook. I worked alongside the Chief Design Officer of SAP and many other high-ranking employees. Someone told me a rumor that our building was Apple's first headquarters (not a confirmed rumor). To think I was working where Steve Jobs may have spent hours working - that was awesome. </p>\n    <h4><span class=\"heading5\">Second Year</span></h4>\n    <p>When I returned to Waterloo I had a new found knowledge of Design Thinking (my team taught this at Stanford). And the understanding that I definitely did not want to do film anymore. Most of my second year is a blur for me, I know we learned coding and business. But I don’t know if we made any projects. </p>\n    <p>After my second year, I knew I wanted to be a UX Designer. But with my background, it was hard to get a UX job. So I reached out to my contacts on LinkedIn and SAP and was able to find a position at SAP Waterloo. Throughout my summer there, I learned more and more about UX. We did a couple of projects there, I worked on a video for SAP’s conference that was played by Hasso Plattner (yes that one). It was only 30 seconds long but it was the most stressful week I’ve ever had.</p>\n    <h2 class=\"header-padding\"><a class=\"font-deco\">My most memorable quote from someone was “I’ve worked here for 30 years and I’ve never got that kind of recognition” after my clip played for all SAP to see.</a></h2>\n    <p> For half the summer we worked on two main projects. One was a game to test our predictive analytics system and another was a movie picker for the Toronto International Film Festival. We had a lot of trouble getting both of these done. TIFF was very slow with getting us the information we needed, and the other project was very difficult in scope (we had to do a lot of testing to make it work). My manager had also given me the task of developing the front-end of both of these websites which for me (someone who barely knew how to code) was a difficult task. That summer I learned a couple of things. I learned how to code HTML and CSS, I learned that projects can sometimes be out of your hands and I learned that Waterloo is a little boring in the summer.</p>\n    <h4><span class=\"heading5\">Third Year</span></h4>\n    <p>The third year was a wild ride for me. In our first semester, I worked on a group project to design a product called Mental Health Indigenous. This was a website designed to help Indigenous people who live in northern Ontario with their mental health. We designed a website where people could learn mental health skills, talk to professionals, talk to friends and learn more about their cultures. </p>\n\n</b-container>\n<b-container>\n<b-row class=\"image-padding\">\n  <b-col cols=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"6\" lg=\"6\" xl=\"6\">\n   <b-img rounded class=\"image-size\" :src=\"hk2\" img-alt=\"This is an image someone took of me sitting on top of Lion's Rock Mountain in Hong Kong.

That semester I learned more about coding, more about working with others and I got to start re-designing a real website. I also learned a lot about interacting with people that are younger than you and teaching them skills.</p>\n<p>In the winter of that year, I went on exchange to Hong Kong. That was incredible. It was so great to be part of a different culture, a different way of life and meet so many different people. I had always loved traveling but this was a step up from traveling. Getting to live in such a bustling city was remarkable and traveling to different countries in Asia was so much fun. I got to go to South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, China, and Macau. </p>\n<p>In the summer of that year, I worked for a start-up called SnapSuite based in Toronto. There was a large focus on learning to code at this position. My manager wanted me to learn VueJS and apply it to several projects. On top of this, I was creating video content, documents and more. I had two main projects one was a coding project to take a design already done and add VueJS to it. This was a learning curve for me, to say the least. The other was a design project. It was to design a portal for companies to have customers log in and create service calls and billing. This was a summer of learning. </p>\n<p>That summer I also started a podcast which was a completely new venture for me. Since starting I’ve hit over 2500 Instagram followers, 1500 listens and I've interviewed 20 people! It’s been so much fun to do the social media, organizing, and creating podcasts.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"heading5\">Now</span></h4>\n<p>That takes us to now. This semester we have a capstone project. My team and I decided to pick what we think was the hardest prompt which was to design a solution to help people with Hidden Disabilities. We ended up picking Autism Spectrum Disorder as the hidden disability to focus on. It has been an incredible learning journey. Going into this project, I barely knew the scope of what ASD contains and how it affects people. I’ve learned so much and there is so much still to learn. We’re working on designing a solution to a problem that people encounter right now. In most of my project’s I’ve been the team lead or project manager, and I’m doing that again for this project. </p>\n<h4><span class=\"heading5\">Accolades & More</span></h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Winner of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~bsarrafz/ArtTech/\">User Experience Design Camp 2.0</a></li>\n  <li>BLND Business and Design Conference <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.mississauga.com/news-story/7182208-graduates-return-with-career-advice/\">Panelist</a></li>\n  <li>Owner and Host of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://theveganambition.com\">The Vegan Ambition</a></li>\n  <li>Actor, Producer, Editor, and Director of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9kg3RLnPdV2UBgenstYHDg\">Dan & Dan Films</a></li>\n  <li>50,000 views on my personal <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DanielsCake/\">YouTube Channel</a></li>\n  <li>2nd Place Winner of the Intel Data Centre Contest</li>\n  <li>Russian Speaker</li>\n  <li>Citizen of Canada and Israel</li>\n  <li>Been to 20 countries and counting</li>\n  <li>I can solve a Rubik’s Cube in under 2 minutes</li>\n  <li>I coded this website!</li>\n  <li>Designed <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BnW-YdRH08T/?taken-by=theveganambition\">2 t-shirts</a> for Farmhouse Garden Animal Home </li>\n  <li>Hasso Plattner introduced a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://youtu.be/tUgTi2CPVCQ?t=871\">video</a> I made to all of SAP</li>\n  <li>I’ve used a 3d printer</li>\n  <li>Designed <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.fashionforchange.ca/\">fashionforchange.ca</a></li>\n  <li>Acted in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://uwaterloo.ca/communication-arts/company-structure\">King Henry the 6th Part 1</a> at the University of Waterloo</li>\n  <li>Someone wrote an <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link text\" href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2015/06/watch-15-minute-video-analysis-of-stanley-kubricks-2001-a-space-odyssey-255299/\">article</a> about a video essay I did once</li>\n</ul>\n</b-container>\n\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data () {\n    return {\n      danielImage: './../../static/images/about/daniel.png',\n      hk1: './../../static/images/about/hongkong1.png',\n      hk2: './../../static/images/about/mountain.jpg',\n      hk3: './../../static/images/about/hongkong2.jpg'\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<!-- Add \"scoped\" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->\n<style scoped>\n@import url(\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Righteous\");\n\nh1 {\n  font-family: \"Righteous\", cursive;\n  font-size: 255px;\n}\nh4{\n  padding-top:20px;\n  padding-bottom:5px;\n}\nh2{\n  font-weight: 800;\n}\n.font-deco{\n  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 62%, #00CC99 0) center center/0% 75% no-repeat;\n  padding: 0 6px 2px 6px;\n    background-size: 100% 100%;\n}\n.header-padding{\n  padding-top:40px;\n  padding-bottom: 40px;\n}\n.image-padding{\n  margin-top:60px;\n}\n.image-padding2{\n  margin-top:30px;\n    margin-bottom: 60px;\n}\n.header-container {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n.no-margin {\n  padding-left: 0px;\n  padding-right: 0px;\n}\n.image-paragraph{\n  font-size:14px;\n  color: #6D6E71;\n  margin-top: 5px;\n\n}\n.link {\n  color: #000000;\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  font-weight: 600;\n  text-decoration-color: #00CC99;\n  -webkit-transition: color 0.7s;

It’s the largest student-run charity in the Kitchener - Waterloo region. They raise up to $20,000 the WE Villages Program. </p>\n  <h4><span class=\"heading5\">Goals</span></h4>\n  <p>In November of 2017, I was hired onto their design team to work on a re-design of their website. Their old website was designed over 5 years ago. It didn’t adapt to different screen sizes, needed a branding and general refresh.</p>\n    <h2 class=\"header-padding\"><a class=\"font-deco\"> Our team of 3 was tasked with re-designing the user experience, the general design, the job application process, and improve sponsor information.</a></h2>\n  <h4><span class=\"heading5\">My Role</span></h4>\n<p>I was hired on as the User Experience Designer. As part of my role, I worked on improving the site architecture, the user experience, and I introduced the initial design feel that we ended up implementing. </p>\n  <h4><span class=\"heading5\">Old Site Review</span></h4>\n  <p>One of the first things we did as part of our re-design was to analyze the old website and figure out what problems people were running into. To do this we did user testing with potential customers and user groups. Some of the things we noticed were that many of the users complained first and foremost about the design. It is simply unappealing and very outdated. A second thing that people had difficulty with was finding information, there is a disconnect between the information that we were trying to communicate and what the website was showing. Other insights included difficulty applying to jobs and finding information for sponsors. </p>\n<h2 class=\"header-padding\"><a class=\"font-deco\">\"I had no idea how to find anything.\"</a></h2>\n</b-container>\n<b-container>\n<b-row>\n  <b-col cols=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"4\" lg=\"4\" xl=\"4\">\n   <b-img rounded class=\"image-size\" :src=\"fc_home\" img-alt=\"\"></b-img>\n  </b-col>\n    <b-col cols=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"4\" lg=\"4\" xl=\"4\">\n   <b-img rounded class=\"image-size\" :src=\"fc_about\" img-alt=\"\"></b-img>\n  </b-col>\n    <b-col cols=\"12\" sm=\"12\" md=\"4\" lg=\"4\" xl=\"4\">\n   <b-img rounded class=\"image-size\" :src=\"fc_job\" img-alt=\"\"></b-img>\n  </b-col>\n  </b-row>\n  </b-container>\n  <b-container class=\"middle-margin\">\n    <h4><span class=\"heading5\">Users and Personas</span></h4>\n    <p>As part of our research and strategy, we designed several different user personas.

I’d been in the “vegan” sphere for a while, and noticed that there were many what I would call “extreme” vegans. I’m not talking about the people who do public awareness campaigns or vegan activists. I am talking about the people who, block their non-vegan friends on Facebook, who get mad and disconnect from those who aren’t vegan. There is some understanding that I have about why these people do this. It’s like people who don’t talk to Trump Supporters because of their political views. But at the same time, it doesn’t make sense to me. Why ignore and block these people, when education is so pivotal. </p>\n<p>During this time, I had a few friends reach out to me about being vegan. I sent them many texts and gave them a lot of information.</p>\n<p>During this drive, it struck me, there aren’t many great areas for vegans and non-vegans to talk. There isn’t a place that accepts people and teaches them. </p>\n<h2 class=\"header-padding\"><a class=\"font-deco\">I had a sudden idea, to create a podcast.

When someone creates an input such as, “Lunch with Patrick at the Robotics Lounge.” </p>\n<p>The several inputs are the person, the place, and the task. </p>\n<p>This means we can prompt to ask if something is wrong with those three and gather information from that. </p>\n<p>We then designed a flowchart example of things going wrong. When doing this we noticed several more issues, sometimes we won’t be able to figure out the actual problem, and that having a “dismiss and call a friend” button on the screen at all times was important. We know that we won’t solve every problem, but we’re trying to make the transition easier for people. We want to avoid as many shutdowns or overloads as possible and if not avoid at least reduce the severity. </p>\n<p>As of now, we have created some mockups and are set into the test phase. We need to know if this works, if this solves a problem, and if it helps. </p>\n </b-col>\n</b-row>\n</b-container>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data () {\n    return {\n
